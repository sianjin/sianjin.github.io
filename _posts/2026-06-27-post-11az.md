In this article, we consider we have already synchronized our 11az packet and obtained integer delay. The rest delay is fractional delay. We consider we have processed channel frequency response (CFR), like interpolating CFR, spatial smoothing, forward-backward (FB) averaging, for fractional delay estimation. Our goal is to estimate the fractional path delays from the processed CFR using the multi-signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. This includes 3 steps: eigen-decomposition, estimate delay profile, and estimate fractional delay.

Signal Model

```python
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hello")
```
